This internship report presents the development of an automated notification system for the Key Management System (KMS) at Renault Digital Morocco. The project addresses the critical need for proactive management of expiring cryptographic resources within Renault Group's security infrastructure.\\

The main objective was to design and implement an intelligent notification system that automatically identifies expiring certificates and keys, and delivers targeted alerts to responsible stakeholders through multiple communication channels. The system prevents service disruptions by providing early warnings before cryptographic resource expiration.\\

The solution was developed using Agile methodology with Java Spring Boot framework. The implementation includes automated resource discovery, role-based notification targeting, multi-channel delivery via email and real-time in-app notifications, and comprehensive audit trail capabilities. The system integrates seamlessly with the existing KMS database architecture.\\

Testing validated the system's ability to reliably identify expiring resources, deliver notifications through REST APIs and WebSocket connections, and maintain operational continuity. The implemented solution transforms reactive resource management into a proactive, automated process, enhancing security compliance and reducing operational risks.\\
